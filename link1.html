			<h2>NoSQL Databases: Defined and Explained</h2>
            <img src="https://www.scnsoft.com/blog-pictures/business-intelligence/no-sql-databases.png" width="100%" height="412">
			<p>Alex overviews NoSQL databases, their major benefits and limitations, and outlines the most popular NoSQL database typology. In case you need expert help with developing a high-performing NoSQL database, check ScienceSoft’s offering in database development services.
                If you’ve been around databases for a considerable amount of time, you’re familiar with SQL databases. They generally have a rigid structure due to their schemas and are only vertically scalable, meaning you can only increase performance by buying expensive hardware.
                SQL excels at reducing duplicate content, which helps keep the cost of storage down. It was great during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, when storage came at an expensive premium, but not so much in the 2000s, 2010s, and beyond, when storage is ridiculously cheap.
                As such, there was no real reason to stick to the constraints of SQL, and that’s how NoSQL was born.
                NoSQL (aka ‘not only SQL’) databases can store and retrieve data that is modeled other than the tabular relations in SQL databases, which makes them particularly useful for managing big data.</p>
